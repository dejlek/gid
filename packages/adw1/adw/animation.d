/**
    A base class for animations.
    
    [adw.animation.Animation] represents an animation on a widget. It has a target that
    provides a value to animate, and a state indicating whether the
    animation hasn't been started yet, is playing, paused or finished.
    
    Currently there are two concrete animation types:
    `class@TimedAnimation` and `class@SpringAnimation`.
    
    [adw.animation.Animation] will automatically skip the animation if
    `property@Animation:widget` is unmapped, or if
    `property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-enable-animations` is `FALSE`.
    
    The `signal@Animation::done` signal can be used to perform an action after
    the animation ends, for example hiding a widget after animating its
    [gtk.widget.Widget.opacity] to 0.
    
    [adw.animation.Animation] will be kept alive while the animation is playing. As such,
    it's safe to create an animation, start it and immediately unref it:
    A fire-and-forget animation:
    
    ```c
    static void
    animation_cb (double    value,
                  MyObject *self)
    {
      // Do something with @value
    }
    
    static void
    my_object_animate (MyObject *self)
    {
      AdwAnimationTarget *target =
        adw_callback_animation_target_new ((AdwAnimationTargetFunc) animation_cb,
                                           self, NULL);
      g_autoptr (AdwAnimation) animation =
        adw_timed_animation_new (widget, 0, 1, 250, target);
    
      adw_animation_play (animation);
    }
    ```
    
    If there's a chance the previous animation for the same target hasn't yet
    finished, the previous animation should be stopped first, or the existing
    [adw.animation.Animation] object can be reused.
