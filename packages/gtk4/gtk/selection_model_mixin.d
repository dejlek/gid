/**
    [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] is an interface that add support for selection to list models.
    
    This support is then used by widgets using list models to add the ability
    to select and unselect various items.
    
    GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
    as [gtk.single_selection.SingleSelection], so you will only need to implement this
    interface if you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.
    
    A [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item is
    selected or not. This can be queried via [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.isSelected].
    When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
    `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal by calling the
    [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.selectionChanged] function. The positions given
    in that signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a
    requirement. If new items added to the model via the
    `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal are selected or not is up to the
    implementation.
    
    Note that items added via `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` may already
    be selected and no `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` will be
    emitted for them. So to track which items are selected, it is necessary to
    listen to both signals.
    
    Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
    items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
    to select and unselect items. However, [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel]s are free to only
    implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
    support the unimplemented operations.
    
    When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
    the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
    They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
    selecting is not supported by the model.
    
    Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
    when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.
