/**
    Interface for miscellaneous `class@Session` features.
    
    #SoupSessionFeature is the interface used by classes that extend
    the functionality of a `class@Session`. Some features like HTTP
    authentication handling are implemented internally via
    [soup.session_feature.SessionFeature]s. Other features can be added to the session
    by the application. (Eg, `class@Logger`, `class@CookieJar`.)
    
    See [soup.session.Session.addFeature], etc, to add a feature to a session.
