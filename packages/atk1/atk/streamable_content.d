/**
    The ATK interface which provides access to streamable content.
    
    An interface whereby an object allows its backing content to be
    streamed to clients.  Typical implementors would be images or
    icons, HTML content, or multimedia display/rendering widgets.
    
    Negotiation of content type is allowed. Clients may examine the
    backing data and transform, convert, or parse the content in order
    to present it in an alternate form to end-users.
    
    The AtkStreamableContent interface is particularly useful for
    saving, printing, or post-processing entire documents, or for
    persisting alternate views of a document. If document content
    itself is being serialized, stored, or converted, then use of the
    AtkStreamableContent interface can help address performance
    issues. Unlike most ATK interfaces, this interface is not strongly
    tied to the current user-agent view of the a particular document,
    but may in some cases give access to the underlying model data.

      get_stream to work nonetheless, since not all GIOChannels connect to URIs.
