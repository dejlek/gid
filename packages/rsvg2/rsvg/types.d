    Function to let a user of the library specify the SVG's dimensions
    
    See the documentation for [rsvg.handle.Handle.setSizeCallback] for an example, and

      width = the width of the SVG
      height = the height of the SVG

    Deprecated: Use [rsvg.handle.Handle.renderDocument] instead, which lets you specify
      a viewport size in which to render the SVG document.
