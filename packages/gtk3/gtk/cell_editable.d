      lifetime is temporary and does not persist across other edits and/or cells.

      Connect to `EditingDone` signal.
  
      This signal is a sign for the cell renderer to update its
      value from the cell_editable.
      
      Implementations of #GtkCellEditable are responsible for
      emitting this signal when they are done editing, e.g.
      #GtkEntry emits this signal when the user presses Enter. Typical things to
      do in a handler for ::editing-done are to capture the edited value,
      disconnect the cell_editable from signals on the #GtkCellRenderer, etc.
      
      [gtk.cell_editable.CellEditable.editingDone] is a convenience method
      for emitting #GtkCellEditable::editing-done.

      This signal is meant to indicate that the cell is finished
      editing, and the cell_editable widget is being removed and may
      subsequently be destroyed.
      
      Implementations of #GtkCellEditable are responsible for
      emitting this signal when they are done editing. It must
      be emitted after the #GtkCellEditable::editing-done signal,
      to give the cell renderer a chance to update the cell's value
      before the widget is removed.
