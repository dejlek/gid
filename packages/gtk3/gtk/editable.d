/**
    The #GtkEditable interface is an interface which should be implemented by
  text editing widgets, such as #GtkEntry and #GtkSpinButton. It contains functions
  for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
  signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
  connect to to modify the behavior of a widget.
  
  As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
  the following handler to #GtkEditable::insert-text, an application
  can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.
  
  ## Forcing entry to uppercase.
  
  ```c
  #include <ctype.h>;
  
  void
  insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                       const gchar *text,
                       gint         length,
                       gint        *position,
                       gpointer     data)
  {
    gchar *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);
  
    g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                                 (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
    gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
