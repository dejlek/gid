/**
    #GtkFileChooserDialog is a dialog box suitable for use with
  “File/Open” or “File/Save as” commands.  This widget works by
  putting a #GtkFileChooserWidget inside a #GtkDialog.  It exposes
  the #GtkFileChooser interface, so you can use all of the
  #GtkFileChooser functions on the file chooser dialog as well as
  those for #GtkDialog.
  
  Note that #GtkFileChooserDialog does not have any methods of its
  own.  Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
  #GtkFileChooser.
  
  If you want to integrate well with the platform you should use the
  #GtkFileChooserNative API, which will use a platform-specific
  dialog if available and fall back to GtkFileChooserDialog
  otherwise.
  
  ## Typical usage ## {#gtkfilechooser-typical-usage}
  
  In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
  #GtkFileChooserDialog to select a file for opening:
  
  ```
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
  gint res;
  
  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Open"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);
  
  res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
  if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      char *filename;
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
      filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
      open_file (filename);
      g_free (filename);
    }
  
  gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
  ```
  
  To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:
  
  ```
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooser *chooser;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
  gint res;
  
  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Save"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);
  chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
  
  gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation (chooser, TRUE);
  
  if (user_edited_a_new_document)
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser,
                                       _("Untitled document"));
  else
    gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser,
                                   existing_filename);
  
  res = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
  if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      char *filename;
  
      filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
      save_to_file (filename);
      g_free (filename);
    }
  
  gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);
  ```
  
  ## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up}
  
  There are various cases in which you may need to use a #GtkFileChooserDialog:
  
  $(LIST
    * To select a file for opening. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN.
    
    * To save a file for the first time. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
      and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setCurrentName].
    
    * To save a file under a different name. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
      and set the existing filename with [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setFilename].
    
    * To choose a folder instead of a file. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER.
  )
    
  Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
  using [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setCurrentFolder] in various
  situations, with the intention of letting the application
  suggest a reasonable default folder.  This is no longer
  considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
  able to make good suggestions on its own.  In general, you
  should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
  when it is appropriate to use [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setFilename],
  i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
  have a file saved somewhere.
  
  ## Response Codes ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-responses}
  
  #GtkFileChooserDialog inherits from #GtkDialog, so buttons that
  go in its action area have response codes such as
  #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT and #GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL.  For example, you
  could call [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog.new_] as follows:
  
  ```
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
  
  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Open"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);
  ```
  
  This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use stock
  response identifiers from #GtkResponseType.  For most dialog
  boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
  ones in #GtkResponseType, but #GtkFileChooserDialog assumes that
  its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
  will have one of the following response codes:
  
  $(LIST
    * #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT
    * #GTK_RESPONSE_OK
    * #GTK_RESPONSE_YES
    * #GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY
  )
    
  This is because #GtkFileChooserDialog must intercept responses
  and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
  dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
  response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
  appropriate.
  
  To summarize, make sure you use a
  [stock response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
  when you use #GtkFileChooserDialog to ensure proper operation.
