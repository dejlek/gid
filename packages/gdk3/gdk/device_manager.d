/**
    In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input,
    GDK contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics
    tablets, touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting
    simultaneously with the user interface. Such input devices often have
    additional features, such as sub-pixel positioning information and
    additional device-dependent information.
    
    In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the
    device hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or
    physical devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides
    #GdkDeviceManager.
    
    By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
    keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be
    changed by calling [gdk.global.disableMultidevice] before [gdk.display.Display.open].
    There should rarely be a need to do that though, since GDK defaults
    to a compatibility mode in which it will emit just one enter/leave
    event pair for all devices on a window. To enable per-device
    enter/leave events and other multi-pointer interaction features,
    [gdk.window.Window.setSupportMultidevice] must be called on
    #GdkWindows (or [gtk.widget.Widget.setSupportMultidevice] on widgets).
    window. See the [gdk.window.Window.setSupportMultidevice] documentation
    for more information.
    
    On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2.
    Unless [gdk.global.disableMultidevice] is called, the XInput 2
    #GdkDeviceManager implementation will be used as the input source.
    Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be used.
    
    For simple applications that don’t have any special interest in
    input devices, the so-called “client pointer”
    provides a reasonable approximation to a simple setup with a single
    pointer and keyboard. The device that has been set as the client
    pointer can be accessed via [gdk.device_manager.DeviceManager.getClientPointer].
    
    Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual
    devices (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors
    and keyboard foci that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or
    slave devices) represent the hardware that is controlling the virtual
    devices, and thus have no visible cursor on the screen.
    
    Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
    pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through
    [gdk.device.Device.getAssociatedDevice].
    
    There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could
    be controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also
    be “floating”, which means they are not attached to any virtual device.

    By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all
    master devices, setting the #GdkDevice for all events coming from input
    devices. Events containing device information are #GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY,
    #GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS,
    #GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, #GDK_SCROLL, #GDK_KEY_PRESS, #GDK_KEY_RELEASE,
    #GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY, #GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY, #GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE,
    #GDK_PROXIMITY_IN, #GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT, #GDK_DRAG_ENTER, #GDK_DRAG_LEAVE,
    #GDK_DRAG_MOTION, #GDK_DRAG_STATUS, #GDK_DROP_START, #GDK_DROP_FINISHED
    and #GDK_GRAB_BROKEN. When dealing with an event on a master device,
    it is possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated
    from via [gdk.event.Event.getSourceDevice].
    
    On a standard session, all physical devices are connected by default to
    the "Virtual Core Pointer/Keyboard" master devices, hence routing all events
    through these. This behavior is only modified by device grabs, where the
    slave device is temporarily detached for as long as the grab is held, and
    more permanently by user modifications to the device hierarchy.
    
    On certain application specific setups, it may make sense
    to detach a physical device from its master pointer, and mapping it to
    an specific window. This can be achieved by the combination of
    [gdk.device.Device.grab] and [gdk.device.Device.setMode].
    
    In order to listen for events coming from devices
    other than a virtual device, [gdk.window.Window.setDeviceEvents] must be
    called. Generally, this function can be used to modify the event mask
    for any given device.
    
    Input devices may also provide additional information besides X/Y.
    For example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and X/Y tilt
    information. This information is device-dependent, and may be
    queried through [gdk.device.Device.getAxis]. In multidevice mode, virtual
    devices will change axes in order to always represent the physical
    device that is routing events through it. Whenever the physical device
    changes, the #GdkDevice:n-axes property will be notified, and
    [gdk.device.Device.listAxes] will return the new device axes.
    
    Devices may also have associated “keys” or
    macro buttons. Such keys can be globally set to map into normal X
    keyboard events. The mapping is set using [gdk.device.Device.setKey].
    
    In GTK+ 3.20, a new #GdkSeat object has been introduced that
    supersedes #GdkDeviceManager and should be preferred in newly
    written code.
