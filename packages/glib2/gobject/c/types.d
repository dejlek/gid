/**
    [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] instance (or source) and another property on another [gobject.object.ObjectWrap]
    instance (or target).
    
    Whenever the source property changes, the same value is applied to the
    target property; for instance, the following binding:
    
    ```c
      g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
                              object2, "property-b",
                              G_BINDING_DEFAULT);
    ```
    
    will cause the property named "property-b" of @object2 to be updated
    every time `method@GObject.set` or the specific accessor changes the value of
    the property "property-a" of @object1.
    
    It is possible to create a bidirectional binding between two properties
    of two [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] instances, so that if either property changes, the
    other is updated as well, for instance:
    
    ```c
      g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
                              object2, "property-b",
                              G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL);
    ```
    
    will keep the two properties in sync.
    
    It is also possible to set a custom transformation function (in both
    directions, in case of a bidirectional binding) to apply a custom
    transformation from the source value to the target value before
    applying it; for instance, the following binding:
    
    ```c
      g_object_bind_property_full (adjustment1, "value",
                                   adjustment2, "value",
                                   G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL,
                                   celsius_to_fahrenheit,
                                   fahrenheit_to_celsius,
                                   NULL, NULL);
    ```
    
    will keep the "value" property of the two adjustments in sync; the
    @celsius_to_fahrenheit function will be called whenever the "value"
    property of @adjustment1 changes and will transform the current value
    of the property before applying it to the "value" property of @adjustment2.
    
    Vice versa, the @fahrenheit_to_celsius function will be called whenever
    the "value" property of @adjustment2 changes, and will transform the
    current value of the property before applying it to the "value" property
    of @adjustment1.
    
    Note that #GBinding does not resolve cycles by itself; a cycle like
    
    ```
      object1:propertyA -> object2:propertyB
      object2:propertyB -> object3:propertyC
      object3:propertyC -> object1:propertyA
    ```
    
    might lead to an infinite loop. The loop, in this particular case,
    can be avoided if the objects emit the `GObject::notify` signal only
    if the value has effectively been changed. A binding is implemented
    using the `GObject::notify` signal, so it is susceptible to all the
    various ways of blocking a signal emission, like `func@GObject.signal_stop_emission`
    or `func@GObject.signal_handler_block`.
    
    A binding will be severed, and the resources it allocates freed, whenever
    either one of the [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] instances it refers to are finalized, or when
    the #GBinding instance loses its last reference.
    
    Bindings for languages with garbage collection can use
    [gobject.binding.Binding.unbind] to explicitly release a binding between the source
    and target properties, instead of relying on the last reference on the
    binding, source, and target instances to drop.

/**
    A [gobject.closure.Closure] represents a callback supplied by the programmer.
    
    It will generally comprise a function of some kind and a marshaller
    used to call it. It is the responsibility of the marshaller to
    convert the arguments for the invocation from #GValues into
    a suitable form, perform the callback on the converted arguments,
    and transform the return value back into a #GValue.
    
    In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer
    to a function and maybe a data argument, and the marshaller
    converts between #GValue and native C types. The GObject
    library provides the #GCClosure type for this purpose. Bindings for
    other languages need marshallers which convert between #GValues
    and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
    order to use functions written in that language as callbacks. Use
    [gobject.closure.Closure.setMarshal] to set the marshaller on such a custom
    closure implementation.
    
    Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
    implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
    @c_marshaller argument to [gobject.global.signalNew] specifies the default C
    marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
    signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
    purpose, see the g_cclosure_marshal_*() functions. Additional C
    marshallers can be generated with the [glib-genmarshal][glib-genmarshal]
    utility.  Closures can be explicitly connected to signals with
    [gobject.global.signalConnectClosure], but it usually more convenient to let
    GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
    g_signal_connect_*() functions which take a callback function/user
    data pair.
    
    Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
    callback function/data pointer combination:
    
    $(LIST
      * Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
        which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
        for each callback type.
      
      * The reference counting of #GClosure makes it easy to handle reentrancy
        right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
        and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
      
      * [gobject.closure.Closure.invalidate] and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
        automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.

    The base object type.
    
    [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] is the fundamental type providing the common attributes and
    methods for all object types in GTK, Pango and other libraries
    based on GObject. The [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] class provides methods for object
    construction and destruction, property access methods, and signal
    support. Signals are described in detail [here][gobject-Signals].
    
    For a tutorial on implementing a new [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] class, see [How to define and
    implement a new GObject](tutorial.html#how-to-define-and-implement-a-new-gobject).
    For a list of naming conventions for GObjects and their methods, see the
    [GType conventions](concepts.html#conventions). For the high-level concepts
    behind GObject, read
    [Instantiatable classed types: Objects](concepts.html#instantiatable-classed-types-objects).
    
    Since GLib 2.72, all [gobject.object.ObjectWrap]s are guaranteed to be aligned to at least the
    alignment of the largest basic GLib type (typically this is [vte.types.TEST_FLAGS_NONE] or
    [graphene.types.PI_2]). If you need larger alignment for an element in a [gobject.object.ObjectWrap], you
    should allocate it on the heap (aligned), or arrange for your [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] to be
    appropriately padded. This guarantee applies to the [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] (or derived)
    struct, the [gstpbutils.types.ObjectClass] (or derived) struct, and any private data allocated
    by `G_ADD_PRIVATE()`.

    A property name consists of one or more segments consisting of ASCII letters
    and digits, separated by either the `-` or `_` character. The first

    for signal naming (see `func@GObject.signal_new`).
    
    When creating and looking up a [gobject.param_spec.ParamSpec], either separator can be
    used, but they cannot be mixed. Using `-` is considerably more
    efficient, and is the ‘canonical form’. Using `_` is discouraged.

    [gobject.type_module.TypeModule] provides a simple implementation of the [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin]
    interface.
    
    The model of [gobject.type_module.TypeModule] is a dynamically loaded module which
    implements some number of types and interface implementations.
    
    When the module is loaded, it registers its types and interfaces
    using [gobject.type_module.TypeModule.registerType] and
    [gobject.type_module.TypeModule.addInterface].
    As long as any instances of these types and interface implementations
    are in use, the module is kept loaded. When the types and interfaces
    are gone, the module may be unloaded. If the types and interfaces
    become used again, the module will be reloaded. Note that the last
    reference cannot be released from within the module code, since that
    would lead to the caller's code being unloaded before `[gobject.object.ObjectWrap.unref]`
    returns to it.
    
    Keeping track of whether the module should be loaded or not is done by
    using a use count - it starts at zero, and whenever it is greater than
    zero, the module is loaded. The use count is maintained internally by
    the type system, but also can be explicitly controlled by
    [gobject.type_module.TypeModule.use] and [gobject.type_module.TypeModule.unuse].
    Typically, when loading a module for the first type, `[gobject.type_module.TypeModule.use]`
    will be used to load it so that it can initialize its types. At some later
    point, when the module no longer needs to be loaded except for the type
    implementations it contains, `[gobject.type_module.TypeModule.unuse]` is called.
    
    [gobject.type_module.TypeModule] does not actually provide any implementation of module
    loading and unloading. To create a particular module type you must
    derive from [gobject.type_module.TypeModule] and implement the load and unload functions
    in [gobject.type_module_class.TypeModuleClass].

/**
    An interface that handles the lifecycle of dynamically loaded types.
    
    The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types.
    It goes as follows:
    
    1. The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
       the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
       introduces what types), like this:
       ```c
       new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
                                              "TypeName",
                                              new_type_plugin,
                                              type_flags);
       ```
       where `new_type_plugin` is an implementation of the
       [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin] interface.
    
    2. The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
       [gobject.type_class.TypeClass.ref_] or through `func@GObject.type_create_instance`
       (this is being called by [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.new_]) or through one of the above
       done on a type derived from `new_type_id`.
    
    3. This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by calling
       [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.use] and [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo]
       on `new_type_plugin`.
    
    4. At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore, e.g. after
       [gobject.type_class.TypeClass.unref] or `func@GObject.type_free_instance`
       (called when the reference count of an instance drops to zero).
    
    5. This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved
       from [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo] and then it calls
       [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.unuse] on `new_type_plugin`.
    
    6. Things may repeat from the second step.
    
    So basically, you need to implement a [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin] type that
    carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
    to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
    [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo] call. Later, maybe after
    succeeding use/unuse calls, once use_count drops to zero, you can
    unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
    [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.use] and [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin.completeTypeInfo]
    again when the type is needed again.
    
    [gobject.type_module.TypeModule] is an implementation of [gobject.type_plugin.TypePlugin] that
    already implements most of this except for the actual module loading and
    unloading. It even handles multiple registered types per module.

    A structure containing a weak reference to a #GObject.
    
    A [gobject.weak_ref.WeakRef] can either be empty (i.e. point to null), or point to an
    object for as long as at least one "strong" reference to that object
    exists. Before the object's #GObjectClass.dispose method is called,
    every #GWeakRef associated with becomes empty (i.e. points to null).
    
    Like #GValue, #GWeakRef can be statically allocated, stack- or
    heap-allocated, or embedded in larger structures.
    
    Unlike [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.weakRef] and [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.addWeakPointer], this weak
    reference is thread-safe: converting a weak pointer to a reference is
    atomic with respect to invalidation of weak pointers to destroyed
    objects.
    
    If the object's #GObjectClass.dispose method results in additional
    references to the object being held (‘re-referencing’), any #GWeakRefs taken
    before it was disposed will continue to point to null.  Any #GWeakRefs taken
    during disposal and after re-referencing, or after disposal has returned due
    to the re-referencing, will continue to point to the object until its refcount
    goes back to zero, at which point they too will be invalidated.
    
    It is invalid to take a #GWeakRef on an object during #GObjectClass.dispose
    without first having or creating a strong reference to the object.
