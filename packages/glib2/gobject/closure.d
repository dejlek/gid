/**
    A [gobject.closure.Closure] represents a callback supplied by the programmer.
    
    It will generally comprise a function of some kind and a marshaller
    used to call it. It is the responsibility of the marshaller to
    convert the arguments for the invocation from #GValues into
    a suitable form, perform the callback on the converted arguments,
    and transform the return value back into a #GValue.
    
    In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer
    to a function and maybe a data argument, and the marshaller
    converts between #GValue and native C types. The GObject
    library provides the #GCClosure type for this purpose. Bindings for
    other languages need marshallers which convert between #GValues
    and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
    order to use functions written in that language as callbacks. Use
    [gobject.closure.Closure.setMarshal] to set the marshaller on such a custom
    closure implementation.
    
    Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
    implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
    @c_marshaller argument to [gobject.global.signalNew] specifies the default C
    marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
    signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
    purpose, see the g_cclosure_marshal_*() functions. Additional C
    marshallers can be generated with the [glib-genmarshal][glib-genmarshal]
    utility.  Closures can be explicitly connected to signals with
    [gobject.global.signalConnectClosure], but it usually more convenient to let
    GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
    g_signal_connect_*() functions which take a callback function/user
    data pair.
    
    Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
    callback function/data pointer combination:
    
    $(LIST
      * Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
        which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
        for each callback type.
      
      * The reference counting of #GClosure makes it easy to handle reentrancy
        right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
        and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
      
      * [gobject.closure.Closure.invalidate] and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
        automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.

  /**
      Takes over the initial ownership of a closure.
      
      Each closure is initially created in a "floating" state, which means
      that the initial reference count is not owned by any caller.
      
      This function checks to see if the object is still floating, and if so,
      unsets the floating state and decreases the reference count. If the
      closure is not floating, [gobject.closure.Closure.sink] does nothing.
      
      The reason for the existence of the floating state is to prevent
      cumbersome code sequences like:
      
      ```c
      closure = g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data);
      g_source_set_closure (source, closure);
      g_closure_unref (closure); // GObject doesn't really need this
      ```
      
      Because [gobject.global.sourceSetClosure] (and similar functions) take ownership of the
      initial reference count, if it is unowned, we instead can write:
      
      ```c
      g_source_set_closure (source, g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data));
      ```
      
      Generally, this function is used together with [gobject.closure.Closure.ref_]. An example
      of storing a closure for later notification looks like:
      
      ```c
      static GClosure *notify_closure = NULL;
      void
      foo_notify_set_closure (GClosure *closure)
      {
        if (notify_closure)
          g_closure_unref (notify_closure);
        notify_closure = closure;
        if (notify_closure)
          {
            g_closure_ref (notify_closure);
            g_closure_sink (notify_closure);
          }
      }
      ```
      
      Because [gobject.closure.Closure.sink] may decrement the reference count of a closure
      (if it hasn't been called on closure yet) just like [gobject.closure.Closure.unref],
      [gobject.closure.Closure.ref_] should be called prior to this function.

  void sink()
  {
    g_closure_sink(cast(GClosure*)this._cPtr);
  }
}
