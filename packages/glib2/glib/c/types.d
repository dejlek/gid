    A GQuark is a non-zero integer which uniquely identifies a

    Given either the string or the `GQuark` identifier it is possible to
    retrieve the other.
    
    Quarks are used for both
    [datasets and keyed data lists](datalist-and-dataset.html).
    
    To create a new quark from a string, use `func@GLib.quark_from_string`
    or `func@GLib.quark_from_static_string`.
    
    To find the string corresponding to a given `GQuark`, use
    `func@GLib.quark_to_string`.
    
    To find the `GQuark` corresponding to a given string, use
    `func@GLib.quark_try_string`.
    
    Another use for the string pool maintained for the quark functions
    is string interning, using `func@GLib.intern_string` or
    `func@GLib.intern_static_string`. An interned string is a canonical
    representation for a string. One important advantage of interned
    strings is that they can be compared for equality by a simple
    pointer comparison, rather than using `strcmp()`.

    [glib.bookmark_file.BookmarkFile] lets you parse, edit or create files containing bookmarks.
    
    Bookmarks refer to a URI, along with some meta-data about the resource
    pointed by the URI like its MIME type, the application that is registering
    the bookmark and the icon that should be used to represent the bookmark.
    The data is stored using the
    [Desktop Bookmark Specification](http://www.gnome.org/~ebassi/bookmark-spec).
    
    The syntax of the bookmark files is described in detail inside the
    Desktop Bookmark Specification, here is a quick summary: bookmark
    files use a sub-class of the XML Bookmark Exchange Language
    specification, consisting of valid UTF-8 encoded XML, under the
    `<xbel>` root element; each bookmark is stored inside a
    `<bookmark>` element, using its URI: no relative paths can
    be used inside a bookmark file. The bookmark may have a user defined
    title and description, to be used instead of the URI. Under the
    `<metadata>` element, with its owner attribute set to
    `http://freedesktop.org`, is stored the meta-data about a resource
    pointed by its URI. The meta-data consists of the resource's MIME
    type; the applications that have registered a bookmark; the groups
    to which a bookmark belongs to; a visibility flag, used to set the
    bookmark as "private" to the applications and groups that has it
    registered; the URI and MIME type of an icon, to be used when
    displaying the bookmark inside a GUI.
    
    Here is an example of a bookmark file:
    [bookmarks.xbel](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/glib/tests/bookmarks.xbel)
    
    A bookmark file might contain more than one bookmark; each bookmark
    is accessed through its URI.
    
    The important caveat of bookmark files is that when you add a new
    bookmark you must also add the application that is registering it, using
    [glib.bookmark_file.BookmarkFile.addApplication] or [glib.bookmark_file.BookmarkFile.setApplicationInfo].
    If a bookmark has no applications then it won't be dumped when creating
    the on disk representation, using [glib.bookmark_file.BookmarkFile.toData] or
    [glib.bookmark_file.BookmarkFile.toFile].

    A simple refcounted data type representing an immutable sequence of zero or

    The purpose of a #GBytes is to keep the memory region that it holds
    alive for as long as anyone holds a reference to the bytes.  When
    the last reference count is dropped, the memory is released. Multiple
    unrelated callers can use byte data in the #GBytes without coordinating
    their activities, resting assured that the byte data will not change or
    move while they hold a reference.
    
    A #GBytes can come from many different origins that may have
    different procedures for freeing the memory region.  Examples are
    memory from [glib.global.gmalloc], from memory slices, from a #GMappedFile or
    memory from other allocators.
    
    #GBytes work well as keys in #GHashTable. Use [glib.bytes.Bytes.equal] and
    [glib.bytes.Bytes.hash] as parameters to [glib.hash_table.HashTable.new_] or [glib.hash_table.HashTable.newFull].
    #GBytes can also be used as keys in a #GTree by passing the [glib.bytes.Bytes.compare]
    function to [glib.tree.Tree.new_].
    
    The data pointed to by this bytes must not be modified. For a mutable
    array of bytes see #GByteArray. Use [glib.bytes.Bytes.unrefToArray] to create a
    mutable array for a #GBytes sequence. To create an immutable #GBytes from

/**
    The #GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
    condition. Threads can block on a #GCond if they find a certain
    condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
    condition they signal the #GCond, and that causes the waiting
    threads to be woken up.
    
    Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
    threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
    another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
    threads to wake up to collect the data.
    
    Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
    is satisfied:
    ```c
      gpointer current_data = NULL;
      GMutex data_mutex;
      GCond data_cond;
    
      void
      push_data (gpointer data)
      {
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        current_data = data;
        g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
      }
    
      gpointer
      pop_data (void)
      {
        gpointer data;
    
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        while (!current_data)
          g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
        data = current_data;
        current_data = NULL;
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
    
        return data;
      }
    ```
    Whenever a thread calls pop_data() now, it will wait until
    current_data is non-null, i.e. until some other thread
    has called push_data().
    
    The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
    paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
    race between the check of @current_data by the while loop in
    pop_data() and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
    @current_data after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
    waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. #GCond is
    specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
    to sleep atomically.
    
    It is also important to use the [glib.cond.Cond.wait] and [glib.cond.Cond.waitUntil]
    functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
    true.  See [glib.cond.Cond.wait] for an explanation of why the condition may
    not be true even after it returns.
    
    If a #GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
    without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call [glib.cond.Cond.init_]
    on it and [glib.cond.Cond.clear] when done.
    
    A #GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

    [glib.date.Date] is a struct for calendrical calculations.
    
    The [glib.date.Date] data structure represents a day between January 1, Year 1,
    and sometime a few thousand years in the future (right now it will go
    to the year 65535 or so, but [glib.date.Date.setParse] only parses up to the
    year 8000 or so - just count on "a few thousand"). [glib.date.Date] is meant to
    represent everyday dates, not astronomical dates or historical dates
    or ISO timestamps or the like. It extrapolates the current Gregorian
    calendar forward and backward in time; there is no attempt to change
    the calendar to match time periods or locations. [glib.date.Date] does not store
    time information; it represents a day.
    
    The [glib.date.Date] implementation has several nice features; it is only a
    64-bit struct, so storing large numbers of dates is very efficient. It
    can keep both a Julian and day-month-year representation of the date,
    since some calculations are much easier with one representation or the
    other. A Julian representation is simply a count of days since some
    fixed day in the past; for #GDate the fixed day is January 1, 1 AD.
    ("Julian" dates in the #GDate API aren't really Julian dates in the
    technical sense; technically, Julian dates count from the start of the
    Julian period, Jan 1, 4713 BC).
    
    [glib.date.Date] is simple to use. First you need a "blank" date; you can get a
    dynamically allocated date from [glib.date.Date.new_], or you can declare an
    automatic variable or array and initialize it by calling [glib.date.Date.clear].
    A cleared date is safe; it's safe to call [glib.date.Date.setDmy] and the other
    mutator functions to initialize the value of a cleared date. However, a cleared date
    is initially invalid, meaning that it doesn't represent a day that exists.
    It is undefined to call any of the date calculation routines on an invalid date.
    If you obtain a date from a user or other unpredictable source, you should check
    its validity with the [glib.date.Date.valid] predicate. [glib.date.Date.valid]
    is also used to check for errors with [glib.date.Date.setParse] and other functions
    that can fail. Dates can be invalidated by calling [glib.date.Date.clear] again.
    
    It is very important to use the API to access the [glib.date.Date] struct. Often only the
    day-month-year or only the Julian representation is valid. Sometimes neither is valid.
    Use the API.
    
    GLib also features [glib.date_time.DateTime] which represents a precise time.

    [glib.date_time.DateTime] is a structure that combines a Gregorian date and time
    into a single structure.
    
    [glib.date_time.DateTime] provides many conversion and methods to manipulate dates and times.
    Time precision is provided down to microseconds and the time can range
    (proleptically) from 0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999.
    [glib.date_time.DateTime] follows POSIX time in the sense that it is oblivious to leap
    seconds.
    
    [glib.date_time.DateTime] is an immutable object; once it has been created it cannot
    be modified further. All modifiers will create a new [glib.date_time.DateTime].
    Nearly all such functions can fail due to the date or time going out
    of range, in which case null will be returned.
    
    [glib.date_time.DateTime] is reference counted: the reference count is increased by calling
    [glib.date_time.DateTime.ref_] and decreased by calling [glib.date_time.DateTime.unref].
    When the reference count drops to 0, the resources allocated by the [glib.date_time.DateTime]
    structure are released.
    
    Many parts of the API may produce non-obvious results. As an
    example, adding two months to January 31st will yield March 31st
    whereas adding one month and then one month again will yield either
    March 28th or March 29th.  Also note that adding 24 hours is not
    always the same as adding one day (since days containing daylight
    savings time transitions are either 23 or 25 hours in length).

    The [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] data type aims to provide a portable method for
    using file descriptors, pipes, and sockets, and integrating them
    into the main event loop (see [glib.main_context.MainContext]). Currently,
    full support is available on UNIX platforms; support for Windows
    is only partially complete.
    
    To create a new [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] on UNIX systems use
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.unixNew]. This works for plain file descriptors,
    pipes and sockets. Alternatively, a channel can be created for a
    file in a system independent manner using [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.newFile].
    
    Once a [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] has been created, it can be used in a generic
    manner with the functions [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.readChars],
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.writeChars], [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.seekPosition],
    and [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.shutdown].
    
    To add a [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] to the main event loop, use `func@GLib.io_add_watch` or
    `func@GLib.io_add_watch_full`. Here you specify which events you are
    interested in on the [glib.iochannel.IOChannel], and provide a function to be called
    whenever these events occur.
    
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] instances are created with an initial reference count of 1.
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.ref_] and [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.unref] can be used to
    increment or decrement the reference count respectively. When the
    reference count falls to 0, the [glib.iochannel.IOChannel] is freed. (Though it
    isn’t closed automatically, unless it was created using
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.newFile].) Using `func@GLib.io_add_watch` or
    `func@GLib.io_add_watch_full` increments a channel’s reference count.
    
    The new functions [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.readChars],
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.readLine], [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.readLineString],
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.readToEnd], [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.writeChars],
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.seekPosition], and [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.flush]
    should not be mixed with the deprecated functions
    [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.read], [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.write], and

    [glib.key_file.KeyFile] parses .ini-like config files.
    
    [glib.key_file.KeyFile] lets you parse, edit or create files containing groups of
    key-value pairs, which we call "key files" for lack of a better name.
    Several freedesktop.org specifications use key files now, e.g the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec)
    and the [Icon Theme Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec).
    
    The syntax of key files is described in detail in the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
    here is a quick summary: Key files consists of groups of key-value pairs, interspersed
    with comments.
    
    ```txt
    # this is just an example
    # there can be comments before the first group
    
    [First Group]
    
    Name=Key File Example\tthis value shows\nescaping
    
    # localized strings are stored in multiple key-value pairs
    Welcome=Hello
    Welcome[de]=Hallo
    Welcome[fr_FR]=Bonjour
    Welcome[it]=Ciao
    
    [Another Group]
    
    Numbers=2;20;-200;0
    
    Booleans=true;false;true;true
    ```
    
    Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
    
    Groups are started by a header line containing the group name enclosed
    in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next group or
    the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a group.
    
    Key-value pairs generally have the form `key=value`, with the exception
    of localized strings, which have the form `key[locale]=value`, with a
    locale identifier of the form `lang_COUNTRY@MODIFIER` where `COUNTRY`
    and `MODIFIER` are optional. Space before and after the '=' character
    are ignored. Newline, tab, carriage return and backslash characters in
    value are escaped as `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, and `\\\\`, respectively. To preserve
    leading spaces in values, these can also be escaped as `\s`.
    
    Key files can store strings (possibly with localized variants), integers,
    booleans and lists of these. Lists are separated by a separator character,
    typically ';' or ','. To use the list separator character in a value in
    a list, it has to be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.
    
    This syntax is obviously inspired by the .ini files commonly met
    on Windows, but there are some important differences:
    
    $(LIST
      * .ini files use the ';' character to begin comments,
        key files use the '#' character.
      
      * Key files do not allow for ungrouped keys meaning only
        comments can precede the first group.
      
      * Key files are always encoded in UTF-8.
      
      * Key and Group names are case-sensitive. For example, a group called
        [GROUP] is a different from [group].
      
      * .ini files don't have a strongly typed boolean entry type,
         they only have GetProfileInt(). In key files, only
         true and false (in lower case) are allowed.
    )
      
    Note that in contrast to the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
    groups in key files may contain the same key multiple times; the last entry wins.
    Key files may also contain multiple groups with the same name; they are merged
    together. Another difference is that keys and group names in key files are not
    restricted to ASCII characters.
    
    Here is an example of loading a key file and reading a value:
    
    ```c
    g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
    g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
    
    if (!g_key_file_load_from_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", flags, &error))
      {
        if (!g_error_matches (error, G_FILE_ERROR, G_FILE_ERROR_NOENT))
          g_warning ("Error loading key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }
    
    g_autofree gchar *val = g_key_file_get_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", &error);
    if (val == NULL &&
        !g_error_matches (error, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND))
      {
        g_warning ("Error finding key in key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }
    else if (val == NULL)
      {
        // Fall back to a default value.
        val = g_strdup ("default-value");
      }
    ```
    
    Here is an example of creating and saving a key file:
    
    ```c
    g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
    const gchar *val = …;
    g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
    
    g_key_file_set_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", val);
    
    // Save as a file.
    if (!g_key_file_save_to_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", &error))
      {
        g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }
    
    // Or store to a GBytes for use elsewhere.
    gsize data_len;
    g_autofree guint8 *data = (guint8 *) g_key_file_to_data (key_file, &data_len, &error);
    if (data == NULL)
      {
        g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);

    The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex
    (mutual exclusion). It can be used to protect data against shared
    access.
    
    Take for example the following function:
    ```c
      int
      give_me_next_number (void)
      {
        static int current_number = 0;
    
        // now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new

        current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
    
        return current_number;
      }
    ```
    It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
    application. There current_number must be protected against shared
    access. A #GMutex can be used as a solution to this problem:
    ```c
      int
      give_me_next_number (void)
      {
        static GMutex mutex;

        g_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
    
        return ret_val;
      }
    ```
    Notice that the #GMutex is not initialised to any particular value.
    Its placement in static storage ensures that it will be initialised
    to all-zeros, which is appropriate.
    
    If a #GMutex is placed in other contexts (eg: embedded in a struct)
    then it must be explicitly initialised using [glib.mutex.Mutex.init_].

    The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
    reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
    multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
    
    The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
    between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
    one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
    lock via [glib.rwlock.RWLock.writerLock]), multiple threads can gain
    simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
    [glib.rwlock.RWLock.readerLock]).
    
    It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
    lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
    it.
    
    Here is an example for an array with access functions:
    ```c
      GRWLock lock;
      GPtrArray *array;
    
      gpointer
      my_array_get (guint index)
      {
        gpointer retval = NULL;
    
        if (!array)
          return NULL;
    
        g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
        if (index < array->len)
          retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
        g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
    
        return retval;
      }
    
      void
      my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
      {
        g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
    
        if (!array)
          array = g_ptr_array_new ();
    
        if (index >= array->len)
          g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
        g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
    
        g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
      }
     ```
    This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
    (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
    (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
    and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
    of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
    functions is fully multi-thread safe now.

/**
    A [glib.regex.Regex] is the "compiled" form of a regular expression pattern.
    
    [glib.regex.Regex] implements regular expression pattern matching using syntax and
    semantics similar to Perl regular expression. See the
    [PCRE documentation](man:pcrepattern(3)) for the syntax definition.
    
    Some functions accept a @start_position argument, setting it differs
    from just passing over a shortened string and setting `G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL`
    in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion.
    For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
    in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
    subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
    from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
    always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
    boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
    @start_position set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because
    it is able to look behind the starting point to discover that it is
    preceded by a letter.
    
    Note that, unless you set the `G_REGEX_RAW` flag, all the strings passed
    to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
    inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
    "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "à") is two bytes long but it is treated as a
    single character. If you set `G_REGEX_RAW` the strings can be non-valid
    UTF-8 strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two
    bytes and two characters long.
    
    When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in
    the string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline
    sequence use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character
    sequence CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed,
    U+000A, "\n"), VT vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"),
    CR (carriage return, U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
    separator, U+2028), or PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
    
    The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are
    affected by newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline
    character (the same characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed
    with `G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR`, `G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF` and `G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF`
    compile options, and with `G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY`,
    `G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR`, `G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_LF` and
    `G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CRLF` match options. These settings are also
    relevant when compiling a pattern if `G_REGEX_EXTENDED` is set, and an

    A [glib.relation.Relation] is a table of data which can be indexed on any number
    of fields, rather like simple database tables. A [glib.relation.Relation] contains
    a number of records, called tuples. Each record contains a number of
    fields. Records are not ordered, so it is not possible to find the
    record at a particular index.
    
    Note that [glib.relation.Relation] tables are currently limited to 2 fields.
    
    To create a [glib.relation.Relation], use [glib.relation.Relation.new_].
    
    To specify which fields should be indexed, use [glib.relation.Relation.index].
    Note that this must be called before any tuples are added to the
    [glib.relation.Relation].
    
    To add records to a [glib.relation.Relation] use [glib.relation.Relation.insert].
    
    To determine if a given record appears in a [glib.relation.Relation], use
    [glib.relation.Relation.exists]. Note that fields are compared directly, so
    pointers must point to the exact same position (i.e. different
    copies of the same string will not match.)
    
    To count the number of records which have a particular value in a
    given field, use [glib.relation.Relation.count].
    
    To get all the records which have a particular value in a given
    field, use [glib.relation.Relation.select]. To access fields of the resulting
    records, use [glib.tuples.Tuples.index]. To free the resulting records use
    [glib.tuples.Tuples.destroy].
    
    To delete all records which have a particular value in a given
    field, use [glib.relation.Relation.delete_].
    
    To destroy the [glib.relation.Relation], use [glib.relation.Relation.destroy].
    
    To help debug [glib.relation.Relation] objects, use [glib.relation.Relation.print].

    A #GStaticMutex works like a #GMutex.
    
    Prior to GLib 2.32, GStaticMutex had the significant advantage
    that it doesn't need to be created at run-time, but can be defined
    at compile-time. Since 2.32, #GMutex can be statically allocated
    as well, and GStaticMutex has been deprecated.
    
    Here is a version of our give_me_next_number() example using
    a GStaticMutex:
    ```
      int
      give_me_next_number (void)
      {
        static int current_number = 0;
        int ret_val;
        static GStaticMutex mutex = G_STATIC_MUTEX_INIT;
    
        g_static_mutex_lock (&mutex);
        ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
        g_static_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
    
        return ret_val;
      }
    ```
    
    Sometimes you would like to dynamically create a mutex. If you don't
    want to require prior calling to [glib.thread.Thread.init_], because your code
    should also be usable in non-threaded programs, you are not able to
    use [glib.mutex.Mutex.new_] and thus #GMutex, as that requires a prior call to
    [glib.thread.Thread.init_]. In these cases you can also use a #GStaticMutex.
    It must be initialized with [glib.static_mutex.StaticMutex.init_] before using it
    and freed with with [glib.static_mutex.StaticMutex.free] when not needed anymore to
    free up any allocated resources.
    
    Even though #GStaticMutex is not opaque, it should only be used with
    the following functions, as it is defined differently on different
    platforms.
    
    All of the g_static_mutex_* functions apart from
    g_static_mutex_get_mutex() can also be used even if [glib.thread.Thread.init_]
    has not yet been called. Then they do nothing, apart from
    g_static_mutex_trylock() which does nothing but returning true.
    
    All of the g_static_mutex_* functions are actually macros. Apart from
    taking their addresses, you can however use them as if they were
    functions.

    similar to the difference between #GMutex and #GStaticMutex.

/**
    The #GStaticRWLock struct represents a read-write lock. A read-write
    lock can be used for protecting data that some portions of code only
    read from, while others also write. In such situations it is
    desirable that several readers can read at once, whereas of course
    only one writer may write at a time.
    
    Take a look at the following example:
    ```
      GStaticRWLock rwlock = G_STATIC_RW_LOCK_INIT;
      GPtrArray *array;
    
      gpointer
      my_array_get (guint index)
      {
        gpointer retval = NULL;
    
        if (!array)
          return NULL;
    
        g_static_rw_lock_reader_lock (&rwlock);
        if (index < array->len)
          retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
        g_static_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&rwlock);
    
        return retval;
      }
    
      void
      my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
      {
        g_static_rw_lock_writer_lock (&rwlock);
    
        if (!array)
          array = g_ptr_array_new ();
    
        if (index >= array->len)
          g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index + 1);
        g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
    
        g_static_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&rwlock);
      }
    ```
    
    This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
    (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
    (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed once at a time
    and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
    of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
    functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
    
    Most of the time, writers should have precedence over readers. That
    means, for this implementation, that as soon as a writer wants to
    lock the data, no other reader is allowed to lock the data, whereas,
    of course, the readers that already have locked the data are allowed
    to finish their operation. As soon as the last reader unlocks the
    data, the writer will lock it.
    
    Even though #GStaticRWLock is not opaque, it should only be used
    with the following functions.
    
    All of the g_static_rw_lock_* functions can be used even if
    [glib.thread.Thread.init_] has not been called. Then they do nothing, apart
    from g_static_rw_lock_*_trylock, which does nothing but returning true.
    
    A read-write lock has a higher overhead than a mutex. For example, both
    [glib.static_rwlock.StaticRWLock.readerLock] and [glib.static_rwlock.StaticRWLock.readerUnlock] have
    to lock and unlock a #GStaticMutex, so it takes at least twice the time
    to lock and unlock a #GStaticRWLock that it does to lock and unlock a
    #GStaticMutex. So only data structures that are accessed by multiple
    readers, and which keep the lock for a considerable time justify a
    #GStaticRWLock. The above example most probably would fare better with a
    #GStaticMutex.

    [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk] provides efficient storage of groups of strings
    
    String chunks are used to store groups of strings. Memory is
    allocated in blocks, and as strings are added to the [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk]
    they are copied into the next free position in a block. When a block
    is full a new block is allocated.
    
    When storing a large number of strings, string chunks are more
    efficient than using `func@GLib.strdup` since fewer calls to `malloc()`
    are needed, and less memory is wasted in memory allocation overheads.
    
    By adding strings with [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk.insertConst] it is also
    possible to remove duplicates.
    
    To create a new [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk] use [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk.new_].

    To add strings to a [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk], but without duplicating strings
    which are already in the [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk], use [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk.insertConst].
    
    To free the entire [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk] use [glib.string_chunk.StringChunk.free].

    The [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool] struct represents a thread pool.
    
    A thread pool is useful when you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work
    and continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often, the overhead of starting
    and destroying a thread each time might be too high. In such cases reusing already started
    threads seems like a good idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious
    and error-prone.
    
    Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added advantage is, that the
    threads can be shared between the different subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.
    
    To create a new thread pool, you use [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.new_].
    It is destroyed by [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.free].
    
    If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool, use [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.push].
    
    To get the current number of running threads you call [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.getNumThreads].
    To get the number of still unprocessed tasks you call [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.unprocessed].
    To control the maximum number of threads for a thread pool, you use
    [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.getMaxThreads]. and [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.setMaxThreads].
    
    Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept alive by GLib for future use.
    The current number can be fetched with [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.getNumUnusedThreads].
    The maximum number can be controlled by [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.getMaxUnusedThreads] and
    [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.setMaxUnusedThreads]. All currently unused threads
    can be stopped by calling [glib.thread_pool.ThreadPool.stopUnusedThreads].

/**
    The [glib.uri.Uri] type and related functions can be used to parse URIs into
    their components, and build valid URIs from individual components.
    
    Since [glib.uri.Uri] only represents absolute URIs, all [glib.uri.Uri]s will have a
    URI scheme, so [glib.uri.Uri.getScheme] will always return a non-`NULL`
    answer. Likewise, by definition, all URIs have a path component, so
    [glib.uri.Uri.getPath] will always return a non-`NULL` string (which may
    be empty).
    
    If the URI string has an
    [‘authority’ component](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3) (that
    is, if the scheme is followed by `://` rather than just `:`), then the
    [glib.uri.Uri] will contain a hostname, and possibly a port and ‘userinfo’.
    Additionally, depending on how the [glib.uri.Uri] was constructed/parsed (for example,
    using the `G_URI_FLAGS_HAS_PASSWORD` and `G_URI_FLAGS_HAS_AUTH_PARAMS` flags),
    the userinfo may be split out into a username, password, and
    additional authorization-related parameters.
    
    Normally, the components of a [glib.uri.Uri] will have all `%`-encoded
    characters decoded. However, if you construct/parse a [glib.uri.Uri] with
    `G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED`, then the `%`-encoding will be preserved instead in
    the userinfo, path, and query fields (and in the host field if also
    created with `G_URI_FLAGS_NON_DNS`). In particular, this is necessary if
    the URI may contain binary data or non-UTF-8 text, or if decoding
    the components might change the interpretation of the URI.
    
    For example, with the encoded flag:
    
    ```c
    g_autoptr(GUri) uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue", G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED, &err);
    g_assert_cmpstr (g_uri_get_query (uri), ==, "query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue");
    ```
    
    While the default `%`-decoding behaviour would give:
    
    ```c
    g_autoptr(GUri) uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue", G_URI_FLAGS_NONE, &err);
    g_assert_cmpstr (g_uri_get_query (uri), ==, "query=http://host/path?param=value");
    ```
    
    During decoding, if an invalid UTF-8 string is encountered, parsing will fail
    with an error indicating the bad string location:
    
    ```c
    g_autoptr(GUri) uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fbad%3D%00alue", G_URI_FLAGS_NONE, &err);
    g_assert_error (err, G_URI_ERROR, G_URI_ERROR_BAD_QUERY);
    ```
    
    You should pass `G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED` or `G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED_QUERY` if you
    need to handle that case manually. In particular, if the query string
    contains `=` characters that are `%`-encoded, you should let
    [glib.uri.Uri.parseParams] do the decoding once of the query.
    
    [glib.uri.Uri] is immutable once constructed, and can safely be accessed from
    multiple threads. Its reference counting is atomic.
    
    Note that the scope of [glib.uri.Uri] is to help manipulate URIs in various applications,
    following [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). In particular,
    it doesn't intend to cover web browser needs, and doesn’t implement the
    [WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) standard. No APIs are provided to
    help prevent
    [homograph attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack), so
    [glib.uri.Uri] is not suitable for formatting URIs for display to the user for making
    security-sensitive decisions.
    
    ## Relative and absolute URIs
    
    As defined in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4), the
    hierarchical nature of URIs means that they can either be ‘relative
    references’ (sometimes referred to as ‘relative URIs’) or ‘URIs’ (for
    clarity, ‘URIs’ are referred to in this documentation as
    ‘absolute URIs’ — although
    [in constrast to RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.3),
    fragment identifiers are always allowed).
    
    Relative references have one or more components of the URI missing. In
    particular, they have no scheme. Any other component, such as hostname,
    query, etc. may be missing, apart from a path, which has to be specified (but
    may be empty). The path may be relative, starting with `./` rather than `/`.
    
    For example, a valid relative reference is `./path?query`,
    `/?query#fragment` or `//example.com`.
    
    Absolute URIs have a scheme specified. Any other components of the URI which
    are missing are specified as explicitly unset in the URI, rather than being
    resolved relative to a base URI using [glib.uri.Uri.parseRelative].
    
    For example, a valid absolute URI is `file:///home/bob` or
    `https://search.com?query=string`.
    
    A [glib.uri.Uri] instance is always an absolute URI. A string may be an absolute URI
    or a relative reference; see the documentation for individual functions as to
    what forms they accept.
    
    ## Parsing URIs
    
    The most minimalist APIs for parsing URIs are [glib.uri.Uri.split] and
    [glib.uri.Uri.splitWithUser]. These split a URI into its component
    parts, and return the parts; the difference between the two is that
    [glib.uri.Uri.split] treats the ‘userinfo’ component of the URI as a
    single element, while [glib.uri.Uri.splitWithUser] can (depending on the
    [glib.types.UriFlags] you pass) treat it as containing a username, password,
    and authentication parameters. Alternatively, [glib.uri.Uri.splitNetwork]
    can be used when you are only interested in the components that are
    needed to initiate a network connection to the service (scheme,
    host, and port).
    
    [glib.uri.Uri.parse] is similar to [glib.uri.Uri.split], but instead of
    returning individual strings, it returns a [glib.uri.Uri] structure (and it requires
    that the URI be an absolute URI).
    
    [glib.uri.Uri.resolveRelative] and [glib.uri.Uri.parseRelative] allow
    you to resolve a relative URI relative to a base URI.
    [glib.uri.Uri.resolveRelative] takes two strings and returns a string,
    and [glib.uri.Uri.parseRelative] takes a [glib.uri.Uri] and a string and returns a
    [glib.uri.Uri].
    
    All of the parsing functions take a [glib.types.UriFlags] argument describing
    exactly how to parse the URI; see the documentation for that type
    for more details on the specific flags that you can pass. If you
    need to choose different flags based on the type of URI, you can
    use [glib.uri.Uri.peekScheme] on the URI string to check the scheme
    first, and use that to decide what flags to parse it with.
    
    For example, you might want to use `G_URI_PARAMS_WWW_FORM` when parsing the
    params for a web URI, so compare the result of [glib.uri.Uri.peekScheme]
    against `http` and `https`.
    
    ## Building URIs
    
    [glib.uri.Uri.join] and [glib.uri.Uri.joinWithUser] can be used to construct
    valid URI strings from a set of component strings. They are the
    inverse of [glib.uri.Uri.split] and [glib.uri.Uri.splitWithUser].
    
    Similarly, [glib.uri.Uri.build] and [glib.uri.Uri.buildWithUser] can be
    used to construct a [glib.uri.Uri] from a set of component strings.
    
    As with the parsing functions, the building functions take a
    [glib.types.UriFlags] argument. In particular, it is important to keep in mind
    whether the URI components you are using are already `%`-encoded. If so,
    you must pass the `G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED` flag.
    
    ## `file://` URIs
    
    Note that Windows and Unix both define special rules for parsing
    `file://` URIs (involving non-UTF-8 character sets on Unix, and the
    interpretation of path separators on Windows). [glib.uri.Uri] does not
    implement these rules. Use `func@GLib.filename_from_uri` and
    `func@GLib.filename_to_uri` if you want to properly convert between
    `file://` URIs and local filenames.
    
    ## URI Equality
    
    Note that there is no `g_uri_equal ()` function, because comparing
    URIs usefully requires scheme-specific knowledge that [glib.uri.Uri] does
    not have. [glib.uri.Uri] can help with normalization if you use the various
    encoded [glib.types.UriFlags] as well as `G_URI_FLAGS_SCHEME_NORMALIZE`
    however it is not comprehensive.
    For example, `data:,foo` and `data:;base64,Zm9v` resolve to the same
    thing according to the `data:` URI specification which GLib does not
    handle.
*/
struct GUri;

/**
    Many URI schemes include one or more attribute/value pairs as part of the URI
    value. For example `scheme://server/path?query=string&is=there` has two
    attributes – `query=string` and `is=there` – in its query part.
    
    A #GUriParamsIter structure represents an iterator that can be used to
    iterate over the attribute/value pairs of a URI query string. #GUriParamsIter
    structures are typically allocated on the stack and then initialized with

/**
    [glib.variant.Variant] is a variant datatype; it can contain one or more values
    along with information about the type of the values.
    
    A [glib.variant.Variant] may contain simple types, like an integer, or a boolean value;
    or complex types, like an array of two strings, or a dictionary of key
    value pairs. A [glib.variant.Variant] is also immutable: once it’s been created neither
    its type nor its content can be modified further.
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] is useful whenever data needs to be serialized, for example when
    sending method parameters in D-Bus, or when saving settings using
    [[gio.settings.Settings]](../gio/class.Settings.html).
    
    When creating a new [glib.variant.Variant], you pass the data you want to store in it
    along with a string representing the type of data you wish to pass to it.
    
    For instance, if you want to create a [glib.variant.Variant] holding an integer value you
    can use:
    
    ```c
    GVariant *v = g_variant_new ("u", 40);
    ```
    
    The string `u` in the first argument tells [glib.variant.Variant] that the data passed to
    the constructor (`40`) is going to be an unsigned integer.
    
    More advanced examples of [glib.variant.Variant] in use can be found in documentation for
    [[glib.variant.Variant] format strings](gvariant-format-strings.html#pointers).
    
    The range of possible values is determined by the type.
    
    The type system used by [glib.variant.Variant] is [glib.variant_type.VariantType].
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] instances always have a type and a value (which are given
    at construction time).  The type and value of a [glib.variant.Variant] instance
    can never change other than by the [glib.variant.Variant] itself being
    destroyed.  A [glib.variant.Variant] cannot contain a pointer.
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] is reference counted using [glib.variant.Variant.ref_] and
    [glib.variant.Variant.unref].  [glib.variant.Variant] also has floating reference counts —
    see [glib.variant.Variant.refSink].
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] is completely threadsafe.  A [glib.variant.Variant] instance can be
    concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
    problems.
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialized
    form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
    files.  It can perform nearly all deserialization operations in a
    small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
    Serialized [glib.variant.Variant] data can also be sent over the network.
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
    [glib.variant.Variant] instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See [glib.variant_type.VariantType] for
    exceptions.  (However, [glib.variant.Variant]’s serialization format is not the same
    as the serialization format of a D-Bus message body: use
    [GDBusMessage](../gio/class.DBusMessage.html), in the GIO library, for those.)
    
    For space-efficiency, the [glib.variant.Variant] serialization format does not
    automatically include the variant’s length, type or endianness,
    which must either be implied from context (such as knowledge that a
    particular file format always contains a little-endian
    `G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT` which occupies the whole length of the file)
    or supplied out-of-band (for instance, a length, type and/or endianness
    indicator could be placed at the beginning of a file, network message
    or network stream).
    
    A [glib.variant.Variant]’s size is limited mainly by any lower level operating
    system constraints, such as the number of bits in [gobject.types.size_t].  For
    example, it is reasonable to have a 2GB file mapped into memory
    with [glib.mapped_file.MappedFile], and call [glib.variant.Variant.newFromData] on
    it.
    
    For convenience to C programmers, [glib.variant.Variant] features powerful
    varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is
    designed to be embedded in other libraries.
    
    There is a Python-inspired text language for describing [glib.variant.Variant]
    values.  [glib.variant.Variant] includes a printer for this language and a parser
    with type inferencing.
    
    ## Memory Use
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] tries to be quite efficient with respect to memory use.
    This section gives a rough idea of how much memory is used by the
    current implementation.  The information here is subject to change
    in the future.
    
    The memory allocated by [glib.variant.Variant] can be grouped into 4 broad
    purposes: memory for serialized data, memory for the type
    information cache, buffer management memory and memory for the
    [glib.variant.Variant] structure itself.
    
    ## Serialized Data Memory
    
    This is the memory that is used for storing [glib.variant.Variant] data in
    serialized form.  This is what would be sent over the network or
    what would end up on disk, not counting any indicator of the
    endianness, or of the length or type of the top-level variant.
    
    The amount of memory required to store a boolean is 1 byte. 16,
    32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
    use their ‘natural’ size.  Strings (including object path and
    signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
    use the length of the string plus 1 byte.
    
    ‘Maybe’ types use no space at all to represent the null value and
    use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
    equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.
    
    Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
    members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
    array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
    then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
    size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
    overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
    are added as required for alignment of child values.
    
    Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
    required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
    framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
    the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
    bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.
    
    Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
    variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
    item inside the variant.
    
    As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
    In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
    the serialization.
    
    If we add an item ‘width’ that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
    we will use 4 bytes to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
    containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
    aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that’s 2 extra
    bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
    for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
    array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.
    
    If we add another entry, ‘title’ that maps to a nullable string
    that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
    null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
    its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
    padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.
    
    We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
    After the 14 bytes of the first item, that’s 2 bytes required.
    We now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two
    bytes. 14 + 2 + 11 + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item
    dictionary.
    
    ## Type Information Cache
    
    For each [glib.variant.Variant] type that currently exists in the program a type
    information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
    type information structure is required for rapid deserialization.
    
    Continuing with the above example, if a [glib.variant.Variant] exists with the
    type `a{sv}` then a type information struct will exist for
    `a{sv}`, `{sv}`, `s`, and `v`.  Multiple uses of the same type
    will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
    single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
    not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
    [glib.variant.Variant].
    
    Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
    memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
    container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
    maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
    are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.
    
    Array type info structures are `6 * sizeof (void *)`, plus the
    memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
    on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for `a{sv}` would require 30
    bytes of memory (plus allocation overhead).
    
    Tuple type info structures are `6 * sizeof (void *)`, plus `4 *
    sizeof (void *)` for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
    required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
    example, would have a type information structure that consumed
    writable memory in the size of `14 * sizeof (void *)` (plus type
    string)  This means that on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for
    `{sv}` would require 61 bytes of memory (plus allocation overhead).
    
    This means that in total, for our `a{sv}` example, 91 bytes of
    type information would be allocated.
    
    The type information cache, additionally, uses a [glib.hash_table.HashTable] to
    store and look up the cached items and stores a pointer to this
    hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
    are zero items in the type cache.
    
    Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
    that a program will probably only have a very small number of
    different types of values in it and that only one type information
    structure is required for many different values of the same type.
    
    ## Buffer Management Memory
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
    with the various different possible sources of serialized data
    that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
    correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
    [glib.variant.Variant].  This may involve a `func@GLib.free` or
    even [glib.mapped_file.MappedFile.unref].
    
    One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
    serialized data.  The size of the buffer management structure
    is `4 * (void *)`.  On 32-bit systems, that’s 16 bytes.
    
    ## GVariant structure
    
    The size of a [glib.variant.Variant] structure is `6 * (void *)`.  On 32-bit
    systems, that’s 24 bytes.
    
    [glib.variant.Variant] structures only exist if they are explicitly created
    with API calls.  For example, if a [glib.variant.Variant] is constructed out of
    serialized data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
    then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
    entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
    the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
    only 1 [glib.variant.Variant] instance exists — the one referring to the
    dictionary.
    
    If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
    [glib.variant.Variant] instances will exist for those values only for as long
    as they are in use (ie: until you call [glib.variant.Variant.unref]).  The
    type information is shared.  The serialized data and the buffer
    management structure for that serialized data is shared by the
    child.
    
    ## Summary
    
    To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
    strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
    using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 bytes of memory
    for the serialized data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
    bytes for the [glib.variant.Variant] instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
    allocation overhead.  If we were to use [glib.variant.Variant.getChildValue]
    to access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
    bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
    would use more memory for the serialized data and buffer
    management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
    be shared.

    #GVariantDict is a mutable interface to #GVariant dictionaries.
    
    It can be used for doing a sequence of dictionary lookups in an
    efficient way on an existing #GVariant dictionary or it can be used
    to construct new dictionaries with a hashtable-like interface.  It
    can also be used for taking existing dictionaries and modifying them
    in order to create new ones.
    
    #GVariantDict can only be used with `G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARDICT`
    dictionaries.
    
    It is possible to use #GVariantDict allocated on the stack or on the
    heap.  When using a stack-allocated #GVariantDict, you begin with a
    call to [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.init_] and free the resources with a call to
    [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.clear].
    
    Heap-allocated #GVariantDict follows normal refcounting rules: you
    allocate it with [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.new_] and use [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.ref_]
    and [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.unref].
    
    [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.end] is used to convert the #GVariantDict back into a
    dictionary-type #GVariant.  When used with stack-allocated instances,
    this also implicitly frees all associated memory, but for
    heap-allocated instances, you must still call [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.unref]
    afterwards.
    
    You will typically want to use a heap-allocated #GVariantDict when
    you expose it as part of an API.  For most other uses, the
    stack-allocated form will be more convenient.
    
    Consider the following two examples that do the same thing in each
    style: take an existing dictionary and look up the "count" uint32
    key, adding 1 to it if it is found, or returning an error if the
    key is not found.  Each returns the new dictionary as a floating
    #GVariant.
    
    ## Using a stack-allocated GVariantDict

/**
    A type in the [glib.variant.Variant] type system.
    
    This section introduces the [glib.variant.Variant] type system. It is based, in
    large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
    some minor lifting of restrictions. The
    [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
    therefore, provides a significant amount of
    information that is useful when working with [glib.variant.Variant].
    
    The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
    introduction of maybe (or ‘nullable’) types.  Any type in [glib.variant.Variant]
    can be converted to a maybe type, in which case, `nothing` (or `null`)
    becomes a valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
    character `m` to type strings.
    
    The second major change is that the [glib.variant.Variant] type system supports
    the concept of ‘indefinite types’ — types that are less specific than
    the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
    of ‘an array of any type’ in [glib.variant.Variant], where the D-Bus type system
    would require you to speak of ‘an array of integers’ or ‘an array of
    strings’.  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
    characters `*`, `?` and `r` to type strings.
    
    Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
    types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
    may only appear nested inside of arrays.
    
    Just as in D-Bus, [glib.variant.Variant] types are described with strings (‘type
    strings’).  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
    are of the same form as those found in D-Bus.  Note, however: D-Bus
    always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
    strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, ‘signatures’
    are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
    message.  [glib.variant.Variant] deals with single values directly so
    [glib.variant.Variant] type strings always describe the type of exactly one
    value.  This means that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid
    [glib.variant.Variant] type string — except in the case that it is the signature
    of a message containing exactly one argument.
    
    An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
    abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
    indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
    that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
    [glib.variant.Variant.getType] will never return an indefinite type, but
    calling [glib.variant.Variant.isOfType] with an indefinite type may return
    true.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents ‘an
    array of no particular type’, but you can have an ‘array of integers’
    which certainly matches the type of ‘an array of no particular type’,
    since ‘array of integers’ is a subtype of ‘array of no particular
    type’.
    
    This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
    directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
    non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
    the type of [[gtk.widget.Widget]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Widget.html) can
    exist (since [gtk.widget.Widget] is an abstract class), but a [[gtk.window.Window]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Window.html)
    can certainly be instantiated, and you would say that a [gtk.window.Window] is a
    [gtk.widget.Widget] (since [gtk.window.Window] is a subclass of [gtk.widget.Widget]).
    
    Two types may not be compared by value; use [glib.variant_type.VariantType.equal]
    or [glib.variant_type.VariantType.isSubtypeOf]  May be copied using
    [glib.variant_type.VariantType.copy] and freed using [glib.variant_type.VariantType.free].
    
    ## GVariant Type Strings
    
    A [glib.variant.Variant] type string can be any of the following:
    
    $(LIST
      * any basic type string (listed below)
      * `v`, `r` or `*`
      * one of the characters `a` or `m`, followed by another type string
      * the character `(`, followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
        type strings, followed by the character `)`
      * the character `{`, followed by a basic type string (see below),
        followed by another type string, followed by the character `}`
    )
      
    A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
    [glib.variant_type.VariantType.isBasic]) and is always a single character in
    length. The valid basic type strings are `b`, `y`, `n`, `q`, `i`, `u`, `x`,
    `t`, `h`, `d`, `s`, `o`, `g` and `?`.
    
    The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. `aaaaai` and
    `(ui(nq((y)))s)` are both valid type strings, as is
    `a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))`. In order to not hit memory limits,
    [glib.variant.Variant] imposes a limit on recursion depth of 65 nested
    containers. This is the limit in the D-Bus specification (64) plus one to
    allow a [[gio.dbus_message.DBusMessage]](../gio/class.DBusMessage.html) to be nested in
    a top-level tuple.
    
    The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:
    
    $(LIST
      * `b`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN`; a boolean value.
      * `y`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE`; a byte.
      * `n`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16`; a signed 16 bit integer.
      * `q`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16`; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
      * `i`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32`; a signed 32 bit integer.
      * `u`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32`; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
      * `x`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64`; a signed 64 bit integer.
      * `t`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64`; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
      * `h`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE`; a signed 32 bit value
        that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
        descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
      * `d`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE`; a double precision
        floating point value.
      * `s`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING`; a string.
      * `o`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH`; a string in the form
        of a D-Bus object path.
      * `g`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE`; a string in the form of
        a D-Bus type signature.
      * `?`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC`; an indefinite type that
        is a supertype of any of the basic types.
      * `v`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT`; a container type that
        contain any other type of value.
      * `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
        type; the type string `ai`, for example, is the type of an array of
        signed 32-bit integers.
      * `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a ‘maybe’, or
        ‘nullable’, version of that type; the type string `ms`, for example,
        is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
        nothing.
      * `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
        create a tuple type; the type string `(is)`, for example, is the type of
        a pair of an integer and a string.
      * `r`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE`; an indefinite type that is
        a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
      * `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
        string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
        an array to form a dictionary; the type string `a{sd}`, for example, is
        the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
        point values.
      
        The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
        the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
        basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
      * `*`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY`; the indefinite type that is
        a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
        character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
        to mean ‘any number of items’.
    )
      
    Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
    itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string `a*`
    (corresponding to `G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY`) is an indefinite type
    that is a supertype of every array type. `(*s)` is a supertype
    of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
    item is a string.
    
    `a{?*}` is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
    containing dictionary entries where the key is any basic type and
    the value is any type at all.  This is, by definition, a dictionary,
    so this type string corresponds to `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DICTIONARY`. Note
    that, due to the restriction that the key of a dictionary entry must
    be a basic type, `{**}` is not a valid type string.
