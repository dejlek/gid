/**
    A [glib.time_zone.TimeZone] represents a time zone, at no particular point in time.
    
    The [glib.time_zone.TimeZone] struct is refcounted and immutable.
    
    Each time zone has an identifier (for example, ‘Europe/London’) which is
    platform dependent. See [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.new_] for information on the
    identifier formats. The identifier of a time zone can be retrieved using
    [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.getIdentifier].
    
    A time zone contains a number of intervals. Each interval has an abbreviation
    to describe it (for example, ‘PDT’), an offset to UTC and a flag indicating
    if the daylight savings time is in effect during that interval. A time zone
    always has at least one interval — interval 0. Note that interval abbreviations
    are not the same as time zone identifiers (apart from ‘UTC’), and cannot be
    passed to [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.new_].
    
    Every UTC time is contained within exactly one interval, but a given
    local time may be contained within zero, one or two intervals (due to
    incontinuities associated with daylight savings time).
    
    An interval may refer to a specific period of time (eg: the duration
    of daylight savings time during 2010) or it may refer to many periods
    of time that share the same properties (eg: all periods of daylight
    savings time).  It is also possible (usually for political reasons)
    that some properties (like the abbreviation) change between intervals
    without other properties changing.

  /**
      Creates a #GTimeZone corresponding to identifier. If identifier cannot be
      parsed or loaded, null is returned.
      
      identifier can either be an RFC3339/ISO 8601 time offset or
      something that would pass as a valid value for the `TZ` environment
      variable (including null).
      
      In Windows, identifier can also be the unlocalized name of a time
      zone for standard time, for example "Pacific Standard Time".
      
      Valid RFC3339 time offsets are `"Z"` (for UTC) or
      `"±hh:mm"`.  ISO 8601 additionally specifies
      `"±hhmm"` and `"±hh"`.  Offsets are
      time values to be added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to get
      the local time.
      
      In UNIX, the `TZ` environment variable typically corresponds
      to the name of a file in the zoneinfo database, an absolute path to a file
      somewhere else, or a string in
      "std offset [dst [offset],start[/time],end[/time]]" (POSIX) format.
      There  are  no spaces in the specification. The name of standard
      and daylight savings time zone must be three or more alphabetic
      characters. Offsets are time values to be added to local time to
      get Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and should be
      `"[±]hh[[:]mm[:ss]]"`.  Dates are either
      `"Jn"` (Julian day with n between 1 and 365, leap
      years not counted), `"n"` (zero-based Julian day
      with n between 0 and 365) or `"Mm.w.d"` (day d
      (0 <= d <= 6) of week w (1 <= w <= 5) of month m (1 <= m <= 12), day
      0 is a Sunday).  Times are in local wall clock time, the default is
      02:00:00.
      
      In Windows, the "tzn[+|–]hh[:mm[:ss]][dzn]" format is used, but also
      accepts POSIX format.  The Windows format uses US rules for all time
      zones; daylight savings time is 60 minutes behind the standard time
      with date and time of change taken from Pacific Standard Time.
      Offsets are time values to be added to the local time to get
      Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
      
      [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.newLocal] calls this function with the value of the
      `TZ` environment variable. This function itself is independent of
      the value of `TZ`, but if identifier is null then `/etc/localtime`
      will be consulted to discover the correct time zone on UNIX and the
      registry will be consulted or GetTimeZoneInformation() will be used
      to get the local time zone on Windows.
      
      If intervals are not available, only time zone rules from `TZ`
      environment variable or other means, then they will be computed
      from year 1900 to 2037.  If the maximum year for the rules is
      available and it is greater than 2037, then it will followed
      instead.
      
      See
      [RFC3339 §5.6](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6)
      for a precise definition of valid RFC3339 time offsets
      (the `time-offset` expansion) and ISO 8601 for the
      full list of valid time offsets.  See
      [The GNU C Library manual](http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html)
      for an explanation of the possible

  /**
      Finds an interval within tz that corresponds to the given time_,
      possibly adjusting time_ if required to fit into an interval.
      The meaning of time_ depends on type.
      
      This function is similar to [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.findInterval], with the
      difference that it always succeeds (by making the adjustments
      described below).
      
      In any of the cases where [glib.time_zone.TimeZone.findInterval] succeeds then
      this function returns the same value, without modifying time_.
      
      This function may, however, modify time_ in order to deal with
      non-existent times.  If the non-existent local time_ of 02:30 were
      requested on March 14th 2010 in Toronto then this function would
      adjust time_ to be 03:00 and return the interval containing the
      adjusted time.

      Finds an interval within tz that corresponds to the given time_.
      The meaning of time_ depends on type.
      
      If type is `G_TIME_TYPE_UNIVERSAL` then this function will always
      succeed (since universal time is monotonic and continuous).
      
      Otherwise time_ is treated as local time.  The distinction between
      `G_TIME_TYPE_STANDARD` and `G_TIME_TYPE_DAYLIGHT` is ignored except in
      the case that the given time_ is ambiguous.  In Toronto, for example,
      01:30 on November 7th 2010 occurred twice (once inside of daylight
      savings time and the next, an hour later, outside of daylight savings
      time).  In this case, the different value of type would result in a
      different interval being returned.
      
      It is still possible for this function to fail.  In Toronto, for
      example, 02:00 on March 14th 2010 does not exist (due to the leap
      forward to begin daylight savings time).  -1 is returned in that
      case.
