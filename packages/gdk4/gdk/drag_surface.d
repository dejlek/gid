      Connect to `ComputeSize` signal.
  
      Emitted when the size for the surface needs to be computed, when it is
      present.
      
      This signal will normally be emitted during the native surface layout
      cycle when the surface size needs to be recomputed.
      
      It is the responsibility of the drag surface user to handle this signal
      and compute the desired size of the surface, storing the computed size
      in the [gdk.drag_surface_size.DragSurfaceSize] object that is passed to the signal
      handler, using [gdk.drag_surface_size.DragSurfaceSize.setSize].
      
      Failing to set a size so will result in an arbitrary size being used as
      a result.
