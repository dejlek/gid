/**
    [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad] is an interface implemented by devices of type
    [gdk.types.InputSource.TabletPad]
    
    It allows querying the features provided by the pad device.
    
    Tablet pads may contain one or more groups, each containing a subset
    of the buttons/rings/strips available. [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getNGroups]
    can be used to obtain the number of groups, [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getNFeatures]
    and [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getFeatureGroup] can be combined to find out
    the number of buttons/rings/strips the device has, and how are they grouped.
    
    Each of those groups have different modes, which may be used to map each
    individual pad feature to multiple actions. Only one mode is effective
    (current) for each given group, different groups may have different
    current modes. The number of available modes in a group can be found
    out through [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getGroupNModes], and the current mode
    for a given group will be notified through events of type [gdk.types.EventType.PadGroupMode].
