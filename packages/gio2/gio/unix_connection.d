/**
    This is the subclass of [gio.socket_connection.SocketConnection] that is created
    for UNIX domain sockets.
    
    It contains functions to do some of the UNIX socket specific
    functionality like passing file descriptors.
    
    Since GLib 2.72, [gio.unix_connection.UnixConnection] is available on all platforms. It requires
    underlying system support (such as Windows 10 with `AF_UNIX`) at run time.
    
    Before GLib 2.72, `<gio/gunixconnection.h>` belonged to the UNIX-specific GIO
    interfaces, thus you had to use the `gio-unix-2.0.pc` pkg-config file when
    using it. This is no longer necessary since GLib 2.72.
