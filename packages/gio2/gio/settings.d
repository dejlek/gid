/**
    The [gio.settings.Settings] class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
    application settings.
    
    Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
    settings with [gio.settings.Settings] is typically extremely fast: on
    approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
    [glib.hash_table.HashTable] lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in
    terms of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
    for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
    (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
    case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
    a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn’t
    even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
    only ever modify [gio.settings.Settings] keys in response to explicit user action.
    Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
    made during startup — for example, when setting the initial value
    of preferences widgets.  The built-in [gio.settings.Settings.bind]
    functionality is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals
    as a result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
    
    When creating a [gio.settings.Settings] instance, you have to specify a schema
    that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
    values, as well as some other information.
    
    Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
    are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
    can also be ‘[relocatable](#relocatable-schemas)’, i.e. not equipped with
    a fixed path. This is
    useful e.g. when the schema describes an ‘account’, and you want to be
    able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
    
    Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character (`/`)
    and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
    be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
    library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
    `/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/` and `/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/`.
    Paths should not start with `/apps/`, `/desktop/` or `/system/` as
    they often did in GConf.
    
    Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
    restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
    values as [glib.variant.Variant], and allows any [glib.variant_type.VariantType] for
    keys. Key names are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and `-`.
    Furthermore, the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
    with a `-`, and must not contain consecutive dashes.
    
    Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
    localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
    and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
    `gettext-domain` attribute of the `<schemalist>` or `<schema>`
    elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
    the `<default>` element. The string which is translated includes all text in
    the `<default>` element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
    
    The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
    [locale category for
    translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
    The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
    translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
    XML comment immediately above the `<default>` element — it is recommended to
    add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
    implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
    attribute can be set on the `<default>` element to disambiguate multiple
    defaults which use the same string.
    
    For example:
    ```xml
     <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
          GVariant serialization syntax.
          See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
     <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
    ```
    
    Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
    [glib.variant.Variant]s (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or
    runtime errors will occur.
    
    GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
    by the [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html)
    utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
    
    A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
    [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
    
    The [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) tool expects schema
    files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
    
    At runtime, schemas are identified by their ID (as specified in the
    `id` attribute of the `<schema>` element). The convention for schema
    IDs is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
    e.g. `org.gnome.SessionManager`. In particular, if the settings are
    for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
    and schema ID should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
    associated with one named application, the ID should not use
    StudlyCaps, e.g. `org.gnome.font-rendering`.
    
    In addition to [glib.variant.Variant] types, keys can have types that have
    enumerated types. These can be described by a `<choice>`,
    `<enum>` or `<flags>` element, as seen in the
    second example below. The underlying type of such a key
    is string, but you can use [gio.settings.Settings.getEnum],
    [gio.settings.Settings.setEnum], [gio.settings.Settings.getFlags],
    [gio.settings.Settings.setFlags] access the numeric values corresponding to
    the string value of enum and flags keys.
    
    An example for default value:
    ```xml
    <schemalist>
      <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
    
        <key name="greeting" type="s">
          <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
          <summary>A greeting</summary>
          <description>
            Greeting of the invading martians
          </description>
        </key>
    
        <key name="box" type="(ii)">
          <default>(20,30)</default>
        </key>
    
        <key name="empty-string" type="s">
          <default>""</default>
          <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
        </key>
    
      </schema>
    </schemalist>
    ```
    
    An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
    ```xml
    <schemalist>
    
      <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
        <value nick="first" value="1"/>
        <value nick="second" value="2"/>
      </enum>
    
      <flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags">
        <value nick="flag1" value="1"/>
        <value nick="flag2" value="2"/>
        <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
      </flags>
    
      <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
    
        <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
          <range min="1" max="100"/>
          <default>10</default>
        </key>
    
        <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
          <choices>
            <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
            <choice value='Annabeth'/>
            <choice value='Joe'/>
          </choices>
          <aliases>
            <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>
            <alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/>
          </aliases>
          <default>'Joe'</default>
        </key>
    
        <key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'>
          <default>'first'</default>
        </key>
    
        <key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'>
          <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
        </key>
      </schema>
    </schemalist>
    ```
    
    ## Vendor overrides
    
    Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
    an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
    to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
    is inconvenient and error-prone,
    [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) reads so-called ‘vendor
    override’ files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
    schema sources which can override default values. The schema ID serves
    as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
    serialized [glib.variant.Variant] form, as in the following example:
    ```
    [org.gtk.Example]
    key1='string'
    key2=1.5
    ```
    
    `glib-compile-schemas` expects schema files to have the extension
    `.gschema.override`.
    
    ## Binding
    
    A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind [gobject.object.ObjectWrap]
    properties directly to settings, using [gio.settings.Settings.bind]. Once a
    [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] property has been bound to a setting, changes on
    either side are automatically propagated to the other side. GSettings handles
    details like mapping between [gobject.object.ObjectWrap] and [glib.variant.Variant]
    types, and preventing infinite cycles.
    
    This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
    underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
    looks for a boolean property with the name `sensitivity` and
    automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
    If this ‘magic’ gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
    [gio.types.SettingsBindFlags.NoSensitivity] flag.
    
    ## Relocatable schemas
    
    A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
    `<schema>` element. By using [gio.settings.Settings.newWithPath], a [gio.settings.Settings]
    object can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
    instance. Paths passed to [gio.settings.Settings.newWithPath] will typically be
    constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
    identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
    be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
    dependency library.
    
    For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
    for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
    `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
    `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
    `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
    they can be specified as `<child>` elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
    ```xml
    <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
      <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
    </schema>
    ```
    
    ## Build system integration
    
    GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
    installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
    following to your `configure.ac`:
    ```
    GLIB_GSETTINGS
    ```
    
    In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
    install the named schema:
    ```
    gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
    EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
    
    @GSETTINGS_RULES@
    ```
    
    No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
    translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
    be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
    0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
    ```
    data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
    ```
    
    Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
    ```
    [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
    ```
    
    GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the `<summary>` and
    `<description>` elements, and also any `<default>` elements which have a
    `l10n` attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml`
    file by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
    `.gschema.xml.in` template.
    
    If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
    schema, it can either be defined manually using an `<enum>` element in the
    schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
    approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
    synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
    ```
    gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
    gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
    ```
    
    `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
    which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
    `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
    automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
    rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
    `EXTRA_DIST`.
