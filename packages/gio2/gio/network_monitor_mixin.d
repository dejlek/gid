      Real-world networks are of course much more complicated than
      this; the machine may be connected to a wifi hotspot that
      requires payment before allowing traffic through, or may be
      connected to a functioning router that has lost its own upstream
      connectivity. Some hosts might only be accessible when a VPN is
      active. Other hosts might only be accessible when the VPN is
      not active. Thus, it is best to use [gio.network_monitor.NetworkMonitor.canReach]
      or [gio.network_monitor.NetworkMonitor.canReachAsync] to test for reachability
      on a host-by-host basis. (On the other hand, when the property is
      false, the application can reasonably expect that no remote
      hosts at all are reachable, and should indicate this to the user
      in its UI.)
      
      See also #GNetworkMonitor::network-changed.

  /**
      Get `networkMetered` property.
      Returns: Whether the network is considered metered.
      
      That is, whether the
      system has traffic flowing through the default connection that is
      subject to limitations set by service providers. For example, traffic
      might be billed by the amount of data transmitted, or there might be a
      quota on the amount of traffic per month. This is typical with tethered
      connections (3G and 4G) and in such situations, bandwidth intensive
      applications may wish to avoid network activity where possible if it will
      cost the user money or use up their limited quota. Anything more than a
      few hundreds of kilobytes of data usage per hour should be avoided without
      asking permission from the user.
      
      If more information is required about specific devices then the
      system network management API should be used instead (for example,
      NetworkManager or ConnMan).
      
      If this information is not available then no networks will be
      marked as metered.

      connectable, it may still block for a brief period of time (eg,
