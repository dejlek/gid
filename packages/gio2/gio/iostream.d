/**
    [gio.iostream.IOStream] represents an object that has both read and write streams.
    Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
    but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
    seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
    
    Examples of [gio.iostream.IOStream] objects are [gio.socket_connection.SocketConnection], which represents
    a two-way network connection; and [gio.file_iostream.FileIOStream], which represents a
    file handle opened in read-write mode.
    
    To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
    with [gio.iostream.IOStream.getInputStream] and
    [gio.iostream.IOStream.getOutputStream].
    
    The [gio.iostream.IOStream] object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
    way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the [gio.iostream.IOStream]
    object alive. If the [gio.iostream.IOStream] object is freed it will be closed, thus
    closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
    always return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed] for all operations.
    
    To close a stream use [gio.iostream.IOStream.close] which will close the common
    stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
    the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
    substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
    [gio.iostream.IOStream] may still be open. However, some streams may support
    ‘half-closed’ states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
    
    Operations on [gio.iostream.IOStream]s cannot be started while another operation on the
    [gio.iostream.IOStream] or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
    read from the [gio.input_stream.InputStream] and write to the
    [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] simultaneously (either in separate threads, or as
    asynchronous operations in the same thread), but an application cannot start
    any [gio.iostream.IOStream] operation while there is a [gio.iostream.IOStream], [gio.input_stream.InputStream] or
    [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] operation in progress, and an application can’t start any
    [gio.input_stream.InputStream] or [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] operation while there is a [gio.iostream.IOStream]
    operation in progress.
    
    This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
    given [glib.main_context.MainContext] (the thread-default context at the time the
    operation was started), rather than entire streams being associated with a
    single [glib.main_context.MainContext].
    
    GIO may run operations on [gio.iostream.IOStream]s from other (worker) threads, and this
    may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
    as [gio.buffered_input_stream.BufferedInputStream] or [gio.tls_connection.TlsConnection]. With such
    wrapper APIs, application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped)
    stream when the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such
    operations may not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves
    the base stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

  /**
      Closes the stream, releasing resources related to it. This will also
      close the individual input and output streams, if they are not already
      closed.
      
      Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return
      [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed]. Closing a stream multiple times will not
      return an error.
      
      Closing a stream will automatically flush any outstanding buffers
      in the stream.
      
      Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
      is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
      resources are released as early as possible.
      
      Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file
      descriptor) open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for
      the individual stream for details.
      
      On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the
      close operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed
      to close will still return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed] for all operations.
      Still, it is important to check and report the error to the user,
      otherwise there might be a loss of data as all data might not be written.
      
      If cancellable is not NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
      triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
      was cancelled, the error [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Cancelled] will be returned.
      Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
      can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
      
      The default implementation of this method just calls close on the
      individual input/output streams.
